### Context {-}  

Exploratory data analyses is everything we have done. This is a primary approach to better understanding your evidence without introducing bias. Transparency is key.      

### Learning outcomes {-}  

1. Practice your critical workflow for data and statistics that is replicable and literate.  
2. Appreciate the value of generalized statistical models that connect to one another conceptually.   
3. Do a GLM.  

### Challenge time {-}  

Here is an impressive ..         

### Reflection questions {-}  

1. When do you move from EDA to model fitting?  
2. Are there ways to mitigate bias and [p-hacking](https://www.wired.com/story/were-all-p-hacking-now/) through formal workflows?  
3. Did building a model such as GLM align with critical thinking and intuition, i.e from critical thinking was it accurate and fair? Did the EDA-to-model process legitimately represent the patterns in the observations recorded.
