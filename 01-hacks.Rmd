Many approaches and critical thinking heuristics in ecology & evolutionary biology (eeb) are relevant to other disciplines.  

### Context {-}  



### Learning outcomes {-}  

1. Develop your data viz skills.  
2. Hone your critical thinking statistically by iterative plotting-modeling a dataset.   
3. Do a regression analysis.  



### Challenge time {-}  



### Reflection questions {-}  

1. When do you use regression versus correlation?  
2. How could you incorporate time into your plots or statistical models?  
3. Did the visualization highlight some of the criteria associated with critical thinking statistically more than others?
